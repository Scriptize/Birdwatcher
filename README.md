# Birdwatcher üê¶

### Birdwatcher is a bot that monitors specific Twitter users' tweets and sends alerts to a Telegram channel whenever a new tweet is posted.

It continuously checks for new tweets, making sure you're always up to date on your favorite accounts.

## Features üöÄ

# How it Works üîç

User Monitoring: The bot fetches the user IDs for the specified usernames.
Tweet Fetching: It then fetches the latest tweets from these users, keeping track of the most recent tweet.
Notification: When a new tweet is found, it sends a message to the Telegram channel with the tweet content.
Repeat: The bot checks for new tweets at regular intervals (every 2 minutes by default).
Error Handling ‚ö†Ô∏è
If the rate limit is exceeded by Twitter, the bot will wait for 15 minutes before retrying.
If there‚Äôs an issue fetching a user or their tweets, the bot logs the error and continues to monitor other users.
